	<description>Okay, it's not actually that tiny. In fact, I'd even venture to say that it got way out of hand.

Special thanks to greyfade for helping with the mirror AI and other code, Neronix17 for the solution to the VFE mod patch, and *Mythos|GER* for finding an error with GloomyFurniture compatibility.

FEATURES:
- 1x1 tables for your cramped quarters.
- 1x1 dressers. Not as luxurious as the full size, but it does add a little something to a small bedroom.
- 1x1 shelves, for when you just don't need a double.
- Picnic blankets! Seats 8 and can be packed for caravans. It's not comfy, but it's better than eating off the floor. For that classic red and white look, make it out of devilstrand.
--- Requires some sort of chair-like item facing it in order for colonists to use it. See below.
- Sitting spot. Can be used with the picnic blanket or anywhere else you'd normally put a chair. Not comfortable, but it gets the job done.
- Floor pillow. A stylish upgrade from sitting on the floor, but not as supportive as a proper chair.
- Includes patch for vanilla dining chairs. Now you can build those out of stone too, because mismatched dining sets are a crime too heinous even for the rim.
- Jade, plasteel and uranium tile for your fancy flooring needs. 
--- The tiles have been fixed to actually match the walls. I kept the original non-matching sets and renamed them to Steampunk Tiles (light and dark).
- Area rugs?! Yes! Build them to fit any shape or size of room. They layer over existing floors. (Requires carpet research.)
- Tatami mats, both 1x2 and 1x3 size. They also layer over existing floors.
- Wall mirrors! Not everyone likes them... but here they are! They'll give a minor mood boost/debuff based on the pawn's appearance. You know, because realism.
- Outdoor lamps, because why not? They'll automatically shut off in the day to save power. Now with rain protection!
- Quilts for single and double beds. They'll add a little comfort, but be careful! They're flammable!

This should be compatible with other furniture mods, including Vanilla Furniture Expanded. I decided to give VFE's 1x1 shelf priority over this one.
Existing shelves from THIS mod from a save will be unaffected, but to build more, you will have to use VFE's shelf.
However, since their outdoor lamp and 1x1 table are different than mine, I decided to keep both pieces.

Wall mirror is now compatible with GloomyFurniture's walls and smoothed stone walls.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Rugs and mats don't yet cover plants. For best results, place on stone terrain or floors only or cut the plants away.
- Rugs and mats also don't layer well over each other.
- Area rugs use Custom9 LinkFlag, so they'll link with any other objects using that flag.
- Quilt placement isn't quite perfect.

DISCLAIMERS:
- Yes, I'm pretty sure at least some of these items have been made before, and probably done better at that. I wanted to try it anyway as I'm still learning how to create mods.
- This should be safe to add to an existing save. If you're removing it from a save, make sure to delete all of the furniture from this mod as well as any dining chairs. Please let me know if you find any issues.
